# test.yml
# This file contains test cases for the CyberGuardian C# application.

# Tests are organized into scenarios.  Each scenario describes a user interaction
# with the chatbot and the expected behavior.
#
# A scenario consists of:
# - name: A descriptive name for the test scenario.
# - user_input: The text the user enters.
# - expected_response: The chatbot's expected response.  This can be a full
#                      string or a fragment (substring) that must be present
#                      in the actual response.
# - check_color: (Optional) If true, the test will also check that the
#                response is printed in the expected color (Green or Red).
#                If omitted, color is not checked.
